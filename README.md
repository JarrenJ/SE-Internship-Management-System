#### Initial Project setup
- Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install yarn (run in a terminal window) - `npm install --global yarn`
- Open terminal window in project directory and run `yarn install`
  - This will install all the dependencies and packages

- You can run `yarn start` to start a local web server (defaults to port 3000)


#### Github Plans

- Assuming we decide to work on separate features, we should each checkout a branch to work on that feature
- Then you can open a Pull Request to merge your work into the `master` branch after it has been reviewed by other members of the group.
