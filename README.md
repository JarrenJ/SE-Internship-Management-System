## Setting Up Local Dev Environment

**Option A** will require 2 terminal windows.

**Option B** only requires 1 terminal window.

**Option A** lets you see the output from the backend and the frontend in 2 seperate windows.

#### Github Plans

- Assuming we decide to work on separate features, we should each checkout a branch to work on that feature
- Then you can open a Pull Request to merge your work into the `master` branch after it has been reviewed by other members of the group.
